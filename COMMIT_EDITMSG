Replace react-router Link with direct calls to history.push

* reasoning:
  ** Children of <Link> retain <a> styling, such as underlines
  ** <Link> by default has its own tabindex
  ** Wrapping buttons with <Link> results in <a><button /></a> which is
  janky html
* Basically, I could use <Link style={{tabIndex: -1, textDecoration:
'none'}}> everywhere or I could just not use Link.
