Fix bug in QuestionSearch browser history

* BUG: after navigating to /search?q={originalSearchTerm}, subsequent searches
did not navigate to /search?q={newSearchTerm} but instead stayed at
/search?q={originalSearchTerm}

* NOTE: we may remove the search term url feature in the future, so that
the browser history doesn't get stored.
